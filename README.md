# CSCI4810Project1
Here I have uploaded a line drawing project that I completed in my CSCI 4810 'Computer Graphics' course at University of Georgia. This program is able to use both the simple and Bresenham line-drawing algorithm.
In order to use this program, you enter the algorithm that you would like to use and the number of random lines that you would like. The program then creates all of these lines and adds them to the raster.
